# Unsupervised and Supervised Methods for Predicting Optoelectronic Properties of Candidate Molecules for Organic Photovoltaic Applications

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our research project for CHEMENG277.  

Our study explores machine learning-based approaches for predicting key optoelectronic metrics:HOMO-LUMO gap and spectral overlap, using easily extractable chemical features. By leveraging unsupervised (K-Means clustering, PCA) and supervised learning (neural networks), we demonstrate that machine learning models can significantly reduce computational costs associated with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
